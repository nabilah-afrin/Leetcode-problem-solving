    "__bucket sort algorithm__\n",
    "\n",
    "Bucket Sort is a sorting algorithm that works by _dividing an array into a fixed number of equally sized buckets_ and then sorting the elements within each bucket. It's a `distribution-based sorting algorithm` and is particularly useful when the input data is uniformly distributed over a range.\n",
    "\n",
    "__How the Bucket Sort algorithm works:__\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Determine the range of input values:__ Find the minimum and maximum values in the input array to determine the range of values.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    min_val, max_val = min(arr), max(arr)\n",

    "```python\n",
    "    bucket_range = (max_val - min_val) / len(arr)\n",
    "    buckets = [[] for _ in range(len(arr))]\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. __Distribute elements into buckets:__ Iterate through the input array and place each element into the corresponding bucket based on a function or formula that maps the element's value to a bucket index. Elements with similar values will be placed in the same bucket.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    for num in arr:\n",
    "        index = int((num - min_val) / bucket_range)\n",
    "        buckets[index].append(num)\n",
    "```\n",
    "4. __Sort each bucket:__ Apply a sorting algorithm (e.g., insertion sort) to sort the elements within each bucket. This step ensures that elements within each bucket are sorted relative to each other.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    sorted_arr = []\n",

    "\n",
    "    return sorted_arr\n",
    "```\n",
