    "# 1. Introduction of linked list\n",
    "<p> A linked list is a linear data structure where elements, called nodes, are connected together using pointers. Each node contains data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence. It's a way to store a collection of elements where each element points to the next one in line. Linked lists can be used to implement various types of data structures like stacks, queues, etc. Linked list doesnâ€™t get backward</p>\n",

    "Why Linked list or BST or other data structure are not created under a function but a class?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encapsulation and Organization:** Classes provide a way to encapsulate the data structure's attributes (such as the head node in a linked list or the root node in a BST) and methods (like insertion, deletion, traversal) within a single unit. This helps in organizing the code and keeping related functionality together.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **State Management:** Data structures often need to maintain some internal state, such as the current size of the linked list or the structure of the tree. Classes allow you to store and manage this state along with the methods that operate on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Abstraction and Reusability:** By using classes, you can create instances of these data structures that encapsulate their behavior. This allows for easy reuse of the same data structure in different parts of your codebase, without duplicating code.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Object-Oriented Paradigm:** Classes and objects are fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). Designing data structures as classes aligns well with the principles of OOP, making the code more modular, maintainable, and extensible.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Complexity and Scalability:** Linked lists and BSTs can become quite complex as you add more features, optimize for performance, or handle edge cases. Organizing this complexity within classes makes it easier to manage and reason about the codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "While you could theoretically implement linked lists or BSTs using functions and global variables, using classes offers a more structured and organized approach. It promotes better code organization, modularity, and reusability."
