    "Output: true\n",

    "\n",

    "We create a modified string that contains only alphanumeric characters, which can be at most n characters long. Therefore, the space complexity for this part is O(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a constant amount of additional space for variables i, j, and a few temporary variables. These do not depend on the input size, so they are considered to be O(1) space.\n",
