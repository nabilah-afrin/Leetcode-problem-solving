    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "In an infinite 2D grid, coordinates of two points are given. The starting cell =` (sx, sy)` and the finishing cell = `(fx,fy)`. Another ` non-negative integer t ` is given as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "It takes 1 second to move to the other adjacent cell. Each cell is surrounded by 8 adjacent cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the starting cell can reach the finishing cell *`after exactly t seconds`*, return True"

    "## Solution\n",
    "The problem seemed quite easy until some edge cases were hard to resolve. At first I tried to solve the problem using euclidean distance, but it failed after 600 test cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to deal with the edge cases we have to consider some factors:\n",
    ">>> when the starting point and finishing points are the same, either it doesnot move at all or it moves several cells and returns to the same position (t is eihter 0 or greater than 1) \n",
    "\n",
    "After considering the edge case, this is the final solution\n",
    "1. return true when t= 0 or t>1 for same starting and finishing points\n",
    "2. find the horizontal and vertical distance\n",
    "3. if the maximum distance between horizontal or vertical is greater then t, then return False\n"
