# Problem Statement
<a href = "https://leetcode.com/problems/widest-vertical-area-between-two-points-containing-no-points/description/"> Widest Vertical Area Between Two Points Containing No Points
</a>

In the given problem, a list of points(x,y) is given for a 2D plane, where _points[i] = [xi, yi]_. The goal is to find the maximum depth between two adjacent points or the distance from left to right between each point.

## Example
```yaml
Input:
points = [[8,7],[9,9],[7,4],[9,7]]
Output:
1
```
# Pseudocode
The solution involves dealing with x-coordinates only in a sorted manner, and finding the maximum distance horizontally between the points.
1.    Extract x-coordinates from the given points.
2.    Sort the x-coordinates.
3.    Initialize *max_width* to zero.
4.    Iterate through the sorted x-coordinates.
        - Update *max_width* with the maximum value between the current width and *max_width*.
5.    Return the final max_width as the result.
```python
def maxWidthOfVerticalArea(points):
    coord = sorted([x[0] for x in points])
    max_width = 0
    for i in range(1, len(coord)):
        max_width = max(max_width, coord[i] - coord[i-1])
    return max_width
```

Widest Vertical Area Between Two Points
Problem Statement

Given a set of points on a 2D plane, where each point is represented as [x, y], find the widest vertical area between two points such that no points are inside the area. A vertical area is defined as an area of fixed width extending infinitely along the y-axis. The goal is to return the maximum width of such vertical areas.
Example

Input:

python

points = [[8,7],[9,9],[7,4],[9,7]]

Output:

python

1

Explanation: Both the red and the blue areas are optimal.
Pseudocode

The solution involves sorting the x-coordinates and finding the maximum width between consecutive points.

    Extract x-coordinates from the given points.
    Sort the x-coordinates.
    Initialize max_width to zero.
    Iterate through the sorted x-coordinates.
        Update max_width with the maximum value between the current width and max_width.
    Return the final max_width as the result.

python

def maxWidthOfVerticalArea(points):
    coord = sorted([x[0] for x in points])
    max_width = 0
    for i in range(1, len(coord)):
        max_width = max(max_width, coord[i] - coord[i-1])
    return max_width

Optimality and Complexity

### Time Complexity: O(nlogn)

he time complexity of this solution is O(nlogn) due to the sorting operation on the x-coordinates, where n is the number of points. The subsequent iteration through the sorted array takes linear time, O(n).
### Space Complexity: O(n)

The space complexity is O(n) due to the storage of x-coordinates in the coord list.

The algorithm is optimal in terms of time and space efficiency. It avoids the need for extra space by updating the maximum width in-place while iterating through the sorted x-coordinates.
