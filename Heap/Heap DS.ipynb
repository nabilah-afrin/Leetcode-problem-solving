    "There are two types of basic heap: min heap and max heap (specificanlly for binary heap). In a max-heap, the value of a parent node is always greater than or equal to the value of its children. In a min-heap, the value of a parent node is always less than or equal to the value of its children.\n",

    "1. Shape Property: The heap is a complete binary tree, meaning all levels of the tree are fully filled except possibly for the last level, which is filled from left to right.\n",
    "2. Heap Property: In a min-heap, for any given node C with parent P, the key (value) of P is less than or equal to the key of C. In a max-heap, it's the opposite: the key of P is greater than or equal to the key of C.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Basic Operations</h4>\n",

    "1. Insertion: Insert a new element into the heap. Place the element at the next available position in the last level of the heap and then \"heapify up\" by swapping the element with its parent until the heap property is restored.\n",

    "Time Complexity: O(log N) - where N is the number of elements in the heap.\n",
