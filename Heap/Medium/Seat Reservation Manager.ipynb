    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "This is a basic level system design problem, where we have to develop a seat management system. There are three main tasks:\n",
    "- `Initiate objects for seat management:` Manage `n` number of avaiable seats starting from 1 (avoid zero indexing).\n",
    "- `resrever() method for seat reservation:` Reserve or take a seat from the available seat starting from 1 to n, the reserved seat will be the smallest; that means initially the first seat that gets reserved is seat number 1. return the seat that just got reserved\n",
    "- `unreserve() method`: Unreserve a seat that with a given *seatnumber*\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "Input\n",
    "[\"SeatManager\", \"reserve\", \"reserve\", \"unreserve\", \"reserve\", \"reserve\", \"reserve\", \"reserve\", \"unreserve\"]\n",
    "[[5], [], [], [2], [], [], [], [], [5]]\n",
    "Output\n",
    "[null, 1, 2, null, 2, 3, 4, 5, null]\n",
    "Explanation\n",
    "SeatManager seatManager = new SeatManager(5); // Initializes a SeatManager with 5 seats.\n",
    "seatManager.reserve();    // All seats are available, so return the lowest numbered seat, which is 1.\n",
    "seatManager.reserve();    // The available seats are [2,3,4,5], so return the lowest of them, which is 2.\n",
    "seatManager.unreserve(2); // Unreserve seat 2, so now the available seats are [2,3,4,5].\n",
    "seatManager.reserve();    // The available seats are [2,3,4,5], so return the lowest of them, which is 2.\n",
    "seatManager.reserve();    // The available seats are [3,4,5], so return the lowest of them, which is 3.\n",
    "seatManager.reserve();    // The available seats are [4,5], so return the lowest of them, which is 4.\n",
    "seatManager.reserve();    // The only available seat is seat 5, so return 5.\n",
    "seatManager.unreserve(5); // Unreserve seat 5, so now the available seats are [5].\n",
    "Constraints:\n",
    "1 <= n <= 105\n",
    "1 <= seatNumber <= n\n",
    "For each call to reserve, it is guaranteed that there will be at least one unreserved seat.\n",
    "For each call to unreserve, it is guaranteed that seatNumber will be reserved.\n",
    "At most 105 calls in total will be made to reserve and unreserve."

    "## Heap approach\n",
    "While dealing with this problem, we have to consider two main factors: \n",
    "* Create a data structure, that will maintain all the seats starting from one\n",
    "* sort the seats, to reserve seats in order\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering these two points, using the *`heapq method`* will be one of the optimal approach, because to reserve the seat, we can automatically get the lowest ekement without the sorting.\n",
    "Hence the approach is listed bellow:\n",
    "1. Create list for `n` number of seats\n",
    "2. use `heappop(list)` to get the lowest seat\n",
    "3. use `heappush(list, seatnumber)` to get a seat available"

Thus, pushing an element, popping an element, and getting the minimum-valued element are all logarithmic time operations because the tree balances itself after each operation.\n",
